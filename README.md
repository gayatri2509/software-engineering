Technology used: JavaFx.


Project Description: This specifies the basic requirements of the project. <br />
User Stories: This describes all the user stories pertaining to this project. <br />
src: This directory has the application logic <br /> 


Questions folder format:
The questions folder should be in the user's Home directory.
The questions folder consists of separate folders for each question. <br />

(n) : Denotes the question number. <br />

Each question folder consists of the following files: <br />
IdealizedModel(n).png <br />
RealWorld(n).png <br />
assumptions(n).txt <br />
reasons(n).txt <br />
score(n).txt <br />

The format of the files is as follows: <br/>

assumptions(n).txt : <br/>
Assumption text | true/false    true:If the assumption is correct; false:otherwise.<br />

reasons(n).txt : <br />
